# Los Piratos de la Casa

An interactive strategic computer&board game, settled in the famous world of 17th century's Caribbean pirates.

## Getting Started

Java 8 is required. To build, use maven (currently there are problems with building FX apps using maven) or IntelliJ IDEA build. Both Windows and Linux are supported.

The project uses JavaFX which is a standard part of Java 8. Ubuntu users with Java 8 without JavaFX can install it with ``sudo apt-get install openjfx``.

## Gameplay

The game is meant to be played by 3 - 6 teams of 1 - 6 players, who are all in the same room, watching the main game view on a big screen / projector.

Intended game rules are available at TODO, but only in Czech. Sorry about that. However, yoy can play with the game without knowing the exact rules, the UI is pretty expressive.

The game text is in Czech, but most of the UI is graphical.

## Versioning

Version number is in format YYYY.n where YYYY is deployment year and n is minor revision. This is convenient for the way the authors use and update the game.
